INTRODUCTION                                    *unimpaired*

This plugin provides several pairs of bracket maps.

NEXT AND PREVIOUS                               *unimpaired-next*

The following maps all correspond to normal mode commands.  If a count is
given, it becomes an argument to the command.  A mnemonic for the "a" commands
is "args" and for the "q" commands is "quickfix".

*[a*     |:previous|
*]a*     |:next|
*[A*     |:first|
*]A*     |:last|
*[b*     |:bprevious|
*]b*     |:bnext|
*[B*     |:bfirst|
*]B*     |:blast|
*[l*     |:lprevious|
*]l*     |:lnext|
*[L*     |:lfirst|
*]L*     |:llast|
*[<C-L>* |:lpfile|
*]<C-L>* |:lnfile|
*[q*     |:cprevious|
*]q*     |:cnext|
*[Q*     |:cfirst|
*]Q*     |:clast|
*[<C-Q>* |:cpfile| (Note that <C-Q> only works in a terminal if you disable
*]<C-Q>* |:cnfile| flow control: stty -ixon)
*[t*     |:tprevious|
*]t*     |:tnext|
*[T*     |:tfirst|
*]T*     |:tlast|

                                                *[f*
[f                      Go to the file preceding the current one
                        alphabetically in the current file's directory.

                                                *]f*
]f                      Go to the file succeeding the current one
                        alphabetically in the current file's directory.

                                                *[n*
[n                      Go to the previous SCM conflict marker.  Try d[n
                        inside a conflict.

                                                *]n*
]n                      Go to the next SCM conflict marker.  Try d]n inside a
                        conflict.

LINE OPERATIONS                                 *unimpaired-lines*

                                                *[<Space>*
[<Space>                Add [count] blank lines above the cursor.

                                                *]<Space>*
]<Space>                Add [count] blank lines below the cursor.

                                                *[e* *v_[e*
[e                      Exchange the current line with [count] lines above it.

                                                *]e* *v_]e*
]e                      Exchange the current line with [count] lines below it.

OPTION TOGGLING                                 *unimpaired-toggling*

On	Off	Toggle	Option
*[ob*	*]ob*	*cob*	'background' (dark is off, light is on)
*[oc*	*]oc*	*coc*	'cursorline'
*[od*	*]od*	*cod*	'diff' (actually |:diffthis| / |:diffoff|)
*[oh*	*]oh*	*coh*	'hlsearch'
*[oi*	*]oi*	*coi*	'ignorecase'
*[ol*	*]ol*	*col*	'list'
*[on*	*]on*	*con*	'number'
*[or*	*]or*	*cor*	'relativenumber'
*[os*	*]os*	*cos*	'spell'
*[ou*	*]ou*	*cou*	'cursorcolumn'
*[ov*	*]ov*	*cov*	'virtualedit'
*[ow*	*]ow*	*cow*	'wrap'
*[ox*	*]ox*	*cox*	'cursorline' 'cursorcolumn' (x as in crosshairs)

PASTING                                         *unimpaired-pasting*

These are experimental:

*>p*    Paste after linewise, increasing indent.
*>P*    Paste before linewise, increasing indent.
*<p*    Paste after linewise, decreasing indent.
*<P*    Paste before linewise, decreasing indent.
*=p*    Paste after linewise, reindenting.
*=P*    Paste before linewise, reindenting.

|]p| and |[p| have also been remapped to force linewise pasting, while
preserving their usual indent matching behavior.

                                                *yp* *yP* *yo* *yO* *yI* *yA*
A toggle has not been provided for 'paste' because the typical use case of
wrapping of a solitary insertion is so wasteful:  You toggle twice, but
you only paste once (YOPO).  Instead, press yp or yP to invoke |a| or |i| with
'paste' already set.  Leaving insert mode sets 'nopaste' automatically.  You
can also use yo, yO, yI, or yA to do the same operation with |o|, |O|,
|I|, or |A|.

ENCODING AND DECODING                           *unimpaired-encoding*

Each of these operations has a map that takes a motion, a map that
targets [count] lines, and a visual mode map.  The linewise variant integrates
with repeat.vim.

Mnemonic: encoding always comes before decoding; "[" always comes before "]".

                                                *[x* *[xx* *v_[x*
[x{motion}              XML encode.
[xx                     <foo bar="baz"> => &lt;foo bar=&quot;baz&quot;&gt;
{Visual}[x

                                                *]x* *]xx* *v_]x*
]x{motion}              XML decode.  HTML entities are handled as well.
]xx
{Visual}]x

                                                *[u* *[uu* *v_[u*
[u{motion}              URL encode.
[uu                     foo bar => foo%20bar
{Visual}[u

                                                *]u* *]uu* *v_]u*
]u{motion}              URL decode.
]uu
{Visual}]u

                                                *[y* *[yy* *v_[y*
[y{motion}              C String encode.  Backslash escape control
[yy                     characters, quotation marks, and backslashes.
{Visual}[y

                                                *]y* *]yy* *v_]y*
]y{motion}              C String decode.
]yy
{Visual}]y

OPTIONS                                       *unimpaired-options*

By putting the variables *g:unimpaired_left* and *g:unimpaired_right* in
your vimrc the activating keys [ and ] can be changed.

E.g.
>
    let g:unimpaired_left = '<'
    let g:unimpaired_right = '>'
<

will change all mappings to <a >a <ob >ob and so on. If either < > or
= is used for either value, the |unimpaired_pasting| mappings will be
replaced by {left}ip {right}ip =ip and so on.


TODO                                            *unimpaired-todo*

Avoid munging null characters when encoding and decoding.
